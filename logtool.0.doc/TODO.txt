arch:
    dunno if having the "r.main" is actually necessary "r.swingintegration" has access to all the business-classes, 
    so i dont actually need to abstract the gui-interaction.
    i should focus on getting that done for now
    
logging:
    - i need to be able to merge logs, do some foundation for that
    - what do i call such a "superlog" that is a composite of multiple underlying ones ?
