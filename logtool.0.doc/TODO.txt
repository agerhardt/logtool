CDI:
    just for understanding this right ... i think the modules in CDI are not necessarily implemented client-side to kinda
    "piece together" the application, but might be better off in the modules (in a project sense) and wrap up basically everything
    this project/module does in a tight little package

TODO @ CDI:
    test if making ApplicationWindow an abstract-class with the operations as members (being assigned by Guice) will work out nicer,
    subclasses would get access to those without having to register, but I dont know how to get the correct module in there
